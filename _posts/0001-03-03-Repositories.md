#### What is a repository?

A repository is is a storage location where digital objects are stored and retrieved. A repository is typically managed by source control or repository management system.


#### Factors to Consider When Choosing a Repository

- Is it open and machine-accessible (e.g. API services) ?
- Does your funder or publisher or institution require or recommend a specific repository?
- Do peer researchers working on similar projects or topics deposit their data there?
- How FAIR are the existing datasets in the repository?
- What are your data licensing options?
- How will the data be preserved? How long does the repository promise to keep the data accessible?
- Does the repository provide
    - Persistent ID for your datasets?
    - Additional services (e.g. data cleanup, validation, format migration/normalization, metadata assistance, etc)
