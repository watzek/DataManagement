#### What is a repository?

A repository is is a storage location where digital objects are stored and retrieved. A repository is typically managed by source control or repository management system.


#### Factors to Consider When Choosing a Repository

- Is it open and machine-accessible (e.g. API services) ?
- Does your funder or publisher or institution require or recommend a specific repository?
- Do peer researchers working on similar projects or topics deposit their data there?
- How FAIR are the existing datasets in the repository?
- What are your data licensing options?
- How will the data be preserved? How long does the repository promise to keep the data accessible?
- Does the repository provide
    - Persistent ID for your datasets?
    - Additional services (e.g. data cleanup, validation, format migration/normalization, metadata assistance, etc)

#### Examples of Repositories Particularly Relevant to Chemistry

- PubChem [https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) 
- Protein Data Bank [https://rcsb.org/](https://rcsb.org)
- ACS Figshare [https://acs.figshare.com/](https://acs.figshare.com) 
- MoNA (MassBank of North America) [https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/](https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/)
- Zenodo [https://zenodo.org/](https://zenodo.org/)
- Dataverse [https://dataverse.org/](https://dataverse.org/) 
- NMRShiftDB [https://nmrshiftdb.nmr.uni-koeln.de/](https://nmrshiftdb.nmr.uni-koeln.de/)
- Protein Circular Dichroism Data Bank [https://pcddb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/](https://pcddb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/) 

#### Disciplinary vs General Repositories

- Is it designed for specific data types in a given discipline?
- Metadata (e.g. fields for instrument metadata)
- Discovery layer (e.g. chemical structure or gene sequence search)
- Visualization (e.g. display 3D crystallographic structure, display Mass Spec etc.)
- Expertise from the core research community
