When storing data, you have four main options:

#### Places to store your data include

- Personal computers (PCs) & laptops
- External storage devices
- Networked Drives
- Cloud servers

Each of these options have significant pros and cons. They are summarized below:

#### Pros and Cons of Data Storage Options

##### Personal Computers

###### Pros
- Data on PCs is easily accessible to the PC's owners.
- Using PCs to store data is essentially free.

###### Cons
- Drive failures are common.
- Laptops are susceptible to theft and unintentional damage.
- Machines can be unusable while making back-ups to external devices.
- PCs are not a long term storage solution.


##### External Storage Devices
###### Pros
- Convenient, cheap, and portable.

###### Cons
- Longevity is not guaranteed. For example, 5.25 inch disks, 3.5 inch disks, Zip drives and other external storage devices are not long-term solutions.
- Errors writing to optical media (CD/DVD) are common.
- Easily scratched, damaged, misplaced or lost, and these issues can create a security risk.
- May not be big enough to hold all data, so multiple drives may be needed


##### Networked Drives
###### Pros
- Networked drives create a single access point for data, which can be backed up regularly.
- Replicated storage is less vulnerable to loss due to hardware failure.
- Secure storage minimizes risk of loss, theft, or unauthorized use.
- Data is available as needed, depending on the network's reliability.

###### Cons
- Some constraints or costs from maintainers.

##### Cloud Servers
###### Pros
- Cloud servers also create a single access point for data, which can be backed up regularly.
- Replicated storage is less vulnerable to loss due to hardware failure.
- Secure storage minimizes risk of loss, theft, or unauthorized use.
- Data is available as needed, depending on the network's reliability.

###### Cons
- Cloud costs may be prohibitive.
- Upload/download speeds may bottleneck or incur fees.
- Export control
