#### What to check for when auditing your data:

- Presence/Absence
- Matching file sizes
- Open-able (accessible)
- Full-scale file comparison (compare checksums)

#### Audit your backups!

Consider these cautionary tales: 

- Magnetic tapes with backups of the servers were being stored in a room next to an elevator, and every time the elevator went past, the magnets erased the tapes. 
- A researcher had made regular backups of her data, 5 GB worth, to an external drive. Her computer hard drive failed, so she sent it to IT, had it repaired, and went to restore her data using what was on her external backup drive. Unfortunately, only 30% of the data were accessible from the drive. â€œThe only thing they could determine was that the software used to back up the data was not compatible with the recovery process.

The moral of the story is: As it turned out, creating backups was not enough to completely guard against tragedy; the only way to make sure those backups could serve their purpose in the event of an emergency was to check them regularly and ensure the data they contained were recoverable.
