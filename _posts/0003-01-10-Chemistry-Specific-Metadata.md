### Chemistry Specific Metadata

#### Bibliographic

##### Creator / Contributor

An ORCID can uniquely identify and disambiguate a single author/creator/researcher. Researchers often include their OpenResearch and Contributor ID (ORCID) with research or data. This is important because there may be many people of the same name even in one specific subject area.

##### Associated Publication

A DOI (Dital Object Identifier) can uniquely identify publications, datasets, and other published resources. They are often generated with new research and data.
