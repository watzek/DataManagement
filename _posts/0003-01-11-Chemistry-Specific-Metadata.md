### Chemistry Specific Metadata

Metadata in chemistry can fit into many different categories. Some of them are outlined here.

#### Bibliographic

##### Creator / Contributor

An ORCID can uniquely identify and disambiguate a single author/creator/researcher. Researchers often include their OpenResearch and Contributor ID (ORCID) with research or data. This is important because there may be many people of the same name even in one specific subject area. Access to an ORCID allows people consuming data to understand who created it and gain insight about what other work that researcher has done.

##### Associated Publication

A DOI (Dital Object Identifier) can uniquely identify publications, datasets, and other published resources. They are often generated with new research and data.

A DOI can allow potential data users to easily access publications related to your data, which can help them better understand the context and applications of the dataset.

##### Creation Date and Time

Including metadata about when the data was created helps provided context to future users. It can help them understand how this data may relate to other data, or how other data may have been based on it. It can also help them understand whether they're using the newest version of the dataset.

##### Data Types

Including metadata about data types provided and used can help with reproducibility and accessibility. Without knowing a datatype, it can be incredibly difficult for potential data users to understand how they should interact with it. Access to information about data types is often necessary in order for other researchers to reproduce work.

##### Funding Information



##### Version Number

Including a version number can help identify which version of a dataset, software, or other digital object was used in a specific experiment. It informs people whether they're using the most recent version of the dataset and of how many other versions exist.

#### Contextual

##### Experimental Conditions

##### Instrument Parameters

##### Other Technical Information

#### Substance/Compound

##### Persistend Identifier

##### Chemical Structure

##### Biomolecular sequence

#### Structural 

#### Rights Management
