Metadata in chemistry can fit into many different categories. Some of them are outlined here.

#### Bibliographic

Bibliographic metadata helps potential data users better understand the data they're accessing. It can help people understand who created the data, why it was created, and how it should be used.

##### Creator / Contributor

An ORCID can uniquely identify and disambiguate a single author/creator/researcher. Researchers often include their OpenResearch and Contributor ID (ORCID) with research or data. This is important because there may be many people of the same name even in one specific subject area. Access to an ORCID allows people consuming data to understand who created it and gain insight about what other work that researcher has done.

##### Associated Publication

A DOI (Dital Object Identifier) can uniquely identify publications, datasets, and other published resources. They are often generated with new research and data.

A DOI can allow potential data users to easily access publications related to your data, which can help them better understand the context and applications of the dataset.

##### Creation Date and Time

Including metadata about when the data was created helps provided context to future users. It can help them understand how this data may relate to other data, or how other data may have been based on it. It can also help them understand whether they're using the newest version of the dataset.

##### Data Types

Including metadata about data types provided and used can help with reproducibility and accessibility. Without knowing a datatype, it can be incredibly difficult for potential data users to understand how they should interact with it. Access to information about data types is often necessary in order for other researchers to reproduce work.

##### Funding Information

Grants frequently require that funding information is assoicated with datasets and other publications. Additionally, it might be useful to potential data readers or users to understand the funding sources of the work they're interested in.

##### Version Number

Including a version number can help identify which version of a dataset, software, or other digital object was used in a specific experiment. It informs people whether they're using the most recent version of the dataset and of how many other versions exist.

#### Contextual

Contextual metadata helps potential data users understand the conditions in which it was created. It helps with reprocudibility and makes it easier to understand how the data was created.

##### Experimental Conditions

Experimental conditions metadata contains information about the environment in which the experiment was carried out. If a potential data user wants to reproduce the experiment, it is much easier with knowledge of experimental conditions.

##### Instrument Parameters

Including information about instrument parameters can help data users understand why the data is the way it is, and can also help with reproducibility.

#### Substance/Compound

Substance/Compound information can help data users understand what the data they are using represents.

##### Persistent Identifier

A persistent identifier, wuch as an InChi Trust ID, can link a chemical structure to an instance of the IUPAC InChI open-source chemical structure representation algorithm. It can help data users find an industry standard notation for the chemical structure of the data.

##### Chemical Structure

Chemical structure information tells data users how the data they're accessing is structured, chemically.

##### Biomolecular sequence

Biomolecular sequence information tells data users about the relation between the data they're accessing and a known identifier of a biomolecular sequence, such as an id in a database like the one hosted by NCBI at NIH.

#### Structural 

Structural metadata, unsurprisingly, tells data users how the data they're interested in is structured. Examples of structural metadata include manifests (lists of data included in the package), file format information, information on how the package is organized, and other information.

One example of such metadata is information about how spectra files relate to the chemical substances reported.

#### Rights Management

Rights management metadata contains information about how data may be used.

##### Data Ownership

Data ownership metadata states who owns the data provided, and who owns derivatives of the data provided. It is important to make sure that potential data users understand the ownership of the data they are using, and that they know who will own any derivatives they produce.

##### Data Licensing

Data licensing metadata contains information about who is allowed to do what with the data provided, and what restrictions may be placed upon those options. Examples include "copyleft" licenses, which state that any derivative work must be released open source, "open-access" licenses, which state that data may be used for any legal purpose without restriction, and "creative" licenses, which state that data may be used for any non-commercial purpose.
