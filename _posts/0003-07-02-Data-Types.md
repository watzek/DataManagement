Data can come in a million different shapes and sizes, and although this list is certainly not exhaustive,
we hope to highlight a few of the most common types of data one might encounter.

##### Observational
Observational data refers to data which is captured in real time by an observer
for example a researcher or some sort of sensor. Observational data is *not*
reproducible so it is sometimes just called unique data.

<br/>
**Examples include**
* Human observation
* Sensor readings
* Survey results

##### Experimental  

Experimental data refers to that which is generated by lab equipment under
controlled conditions. Experimental data should be reproducible up to the
accuracy of your lab equipment, but reproduction can be very expensive.

<br/>
**Examples include**:  
* Gene sequences
* Chromatograms
* Spectroscopy
* Microscopy
* Cell counts

##### Simulation
Simulation data is based off of models created to mimic the behavior of a
actual or theoretical system. Experiments are then run on this model to generate
the actual simulation data. It is often the case when considering a model
and its metadata that the input is more important than output data.

<br/>
**Examples**
* Climate models
* Economic models
* Biogeochemical models

##### Derived or Compiled
Compiled data refers to the data that is a combination of multiple different sources
and even types of data. Derived data types are new variables which are created
from existing data. Like experimental data, derived and compiled data are
reproducible, but this process can be very expensive.

<br/>
**Examples**
* Text and data mining models
* Compiled database
* 3D models

##### Reference & Canonical
Canonical data comes from a static or organic collection of [peer-reviewed]
datasets, likely published and/or curated by others.

<br/>
**Examples**
* Chemical property handbooks
* Census data
* Spatial
* Data portals

##### Other Data Types

* **Geospatial data** has geographical or geospatial aspect. In other words, spatial location is critically tied to other variables.
* **Digital image, audio & video data**
* **Documentation & scripts** Sometimes software and code is data; similarly, documentation
(laboratory notebooks, written observations, etc.) can be considered data.
