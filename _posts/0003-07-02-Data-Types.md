Data can come in a million different shapes and sizes, and although this list is certainly not exhaustive,
we hope to highlight a few of the most common types of data one might encounter.

##### Observational  


Observation data is captured in situ (place of origin).  

<br/>
**Examples include**
* Instrument sensor readings
* Human sensory observations
* Survey results

</span>

##### Experimental  

Experimental data is collected under controlled conditions, in situ or laboratory-based.
Experimental data should be reproducible, but experimental data can be expensive to produce.  

<br/>
**Examples include**:  
* Gene sequences
* Chromatograms
* Spectroscopy
* Microscopy
* Cell counts

##### Simulation

Simulation data are results from a model used to study the behavior and performance of an actual or theoretical system.
A common example is models and their accompanying metadata, where the input can be more important than output data.

<br/>
**Examples**
* Climate models
* Economic models
* Biogeochemical models

##### Derived or Compiled


Compiled data refers to the integration of data from several sources and types of data.
Derived data types are new variables which are created from existing data.  
Like experimental data, derived and compiled data are reproducible, but this process can be very expensive.

<br/>
**Examples**
* Text and data mining models
* Compiled database
* 3D models

<br/>

##### Reference & Canonical


Canonical data comes from a static or organic collection of [peer-reviewed] datasets, likely published and/or curated by others.


<br/>
**Examples**
* Chemical property handbooks
* Census data
* Spatial
* Data portals

##### Other Data Types

* **Geospatial data** has geographical or geospatial aspect. In other words, spatial location is critically tied to other variables.
* **Digital image, audio & video data**
* **Documentation & scripts** Sometimes software and code is data; similarly, documentation
(laboratory notebooks, written observations, etc.) can be considered data.
