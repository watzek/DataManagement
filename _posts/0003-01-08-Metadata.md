#### What is Metadata?

*Metadata* is "Data that provides descriptive information (content, context, quality, structure, and accessibility) about a data product and enables others to search for and use the data product." It uses a Greek prefix "meta" and Latin for "data." "Meta" means "after, behind or beyond" and "data" is factual information used for calculating, reasoning or measuring. Metadata means something behind or beyond data itself, and it includes data about its content, containers and contextual information. 

People have described it as "Data about data," "Structured information that describes, explains, locates, or otherwise makes it easier to retrieve, use, or manage an information resource," and more humorously, "A love letter to the future."

#### Examples of Everyday Metadata

Every library keeps metadata about the books in their collection. Some examples of the metadata they might keep include titles, authors, publishers, subject areas, and synopses.

#### Metadata Fills the Gaps in Data

Metadata helps us answer questions we may have about data:

- Who createed this data?
- What is the content of the data?
- When and where were the data created?
- Where is it located?
- How were the data developed?
- Why was the data developed?

#### Metadata Exsists in Many Places

All of the following are places metadata could exist:

- Lab documentation
- Raw data files from instruments
- Processed data files
- Field notes
- Spreadsheets
- Lab notebooks
- ReadMe files
- In your brain or your colleagues' brains
