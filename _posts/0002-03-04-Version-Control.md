Version control is the management of multiple versions of the same sets of documents. Version control enables us to tell one version of a document from another.  Version control helps track changes that you or your collaborators have made to your data. Version control helps you to retrieve the appropriate version of the file(s) you are seeking. Broadly, there are are two approaches to version control: Maintaining all iterations of files or sets of files so that versions may be revisited, and Tracking changes made through each iteration of files so that the differences between versions is clear.

#### DIY Vesion Control
When using DIY version control, make sure to consider:

- File naming  
    - (e.g. data_v1.csv, data_v1_2.csv, data_v2.csv)
- A ChangeLog.txt, which should include
    - What was changed
    - Who is responsible?
    - When did it happen?
    - Why?


#### Automatic Version Control

DIY version control can be difficult and tedious. In many cases, you can automate the version control practice.

##### Intermediate Level
Commercial software exists to help with simple version control tasks. It includes:
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- Microsoft OneDrive

##### Advanced Level
There are also more advanced version control systems which exist, and can provide more control over what gets saved and logged. They are also often much harder to use and have a steeper learning curve. They include:

- Git and GitHub
- SVN (Service VersioN)
- Perforce Version Control
- Mercurial
