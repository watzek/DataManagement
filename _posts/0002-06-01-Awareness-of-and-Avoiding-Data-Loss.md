Have you ever had your computer crash while you were writing a paper, destroying
hours of work? Imagine that but with months or even years of research data. Yeah
that just might be a little frustrating.

<span class="center">![stages of data loss][comic]<sup>1<span>[PHD comics][comic_source]</span></sup></span>

The first step to protecting yourself from data loss is recognizing the common causes.

##### Computer Trouble
<span class="img-md float-r">![Blue Screen][bluescreen]</span>
We've probably all been here, facing the blue screen of death. If you haven't been here, you will. The blue screen can appear for many reasons, the worst being hard drive failure. When your hard drive breaks, all your data is gone. Period. Things that can contribute hard drive failure are
* Power fluctuations
* Poor ventilation around the computer
* Temperature differential (Sun shining on one side of the computer)
* Vibration,
* or just the luck of the draw

At the end of the day, the best ways to minimize the agony that is hard drive failure are
1. Treat your computer like a baby
2. Back up your data!

Please back up your data either using an external drive or using the cloud. Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox and the dozens of other reputable cloud storage providers are your best friend.

##### Malware
Computer malware is another way you can easily lose your data. There are incredibly smart people out there constantly cooking up new ways to infect your computer, and the internet provides them with the largest window through which to attack you! Possibly one of the most scary types of malware about there is ransomware, seriously look it up. Hackers can literally hold your data ransom; the internet is a dangerous place!  

How can you protect yourself?
* Install an antivirus software
* When a software update is available, update immediately
   - How else can the software makers fix security holes?
* Again, back up your data.
* Learn more about cybersecurity
   - There are so many great resources online for this, but a few highlights:
   - Don't download things unless you are *100%* sure it is safe
   - Don't open PDF's, links, anything from untrusted sources
      - And even if it looks like a trusted source, remember hackers can mimic safe websites and sources to trick you!

##### Physical Theft and Damage
Something else that happens ALL THE TIME: hard drives get stolen, laptops get knocked off of countertops.
Solutions?
Practice good physical security (donâ€™t leave your stuff lying around in the library while you go to another floor to chat with someone else!) and be cognizent of the fragility of your equipment.
