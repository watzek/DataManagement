### What is a data management plan?

A data management plan is a two page (or shorter) document that states how you intend to create, use, maintain, and share data you may create during research. 

#### Anatomy of a Data Management Plan

The NSF specifies five required components for a data mangement plan:

- Products of Research
- Data Formats
- Access to Data & Data Sharing Policies
- Policies for Re-Use, Re-Distribution, and Production of Derivatives
- Archiving of Data

Most research proposals will not be accepted without a data management plan.

The most important things to do in a data management plan are:

- Describing the format and media in which the data or products are stored
- Explaining where data are stored in unusual or not generally-accessible formats
- Explaining how the data may be converted to a more accessible format

 In general, solutions and remedies to providing data in an accessible format should be provided with minimal added cost.



#### More information about Data Management Plans

- The DMP will be reviewed as an integral part of the proposal, considered under Intellectual Merit or Broader Impacts or both, as appropriate for the scientific community of relevance.

- You may request funds to cover costs of publication, page charges, or preparation of data as a direct cost in your budget proposal, which is evaluated as part of the merit review process.

- The project reports should include specific information such as identifier or accession numbers for data sets, metadata and data annotation, citations of relevant publications, conference proceedings, details of software hosting, and other types of data sharing and dissemination, and updated information on project mechanisms for data storage, protection, and backup.

- There should be adequate annotation provided, including what the data is and parameters used to generate it, to allow for reproducibility.

- DMP implementation will also be considered during review of subsequent proposals.
