#### Elements of File & Folder Names

When naming files, consider the following things

- Project, experiment name, or acronym
- Institution or grant name
- Researcherâ€™s name or initials
- Date of experiment (YYYYMMDD)
- Type of data
- Status of file (e.g. draft or final)
- Conditions
- Version number of file (e.g. v1, v2.1)
- Changes made to file
- Application-specific file extensions (e.g.  .spss  or  .r)
