#### Ownership of Data

There are some important questions to answer when thinking about the legality and ethics of research data:

- Is data copyrightable?
- Who does own the data for sponsored research performed in a research institution? 
- What about intellectual properties (IP) derived from data besides copyright?
    - Example: A model predicting reactions can be developed based on data compiled in SciFinder or Reaxys. Would SciFinder and Reaxys always be one of the IP owners of the model? 

#### Data Licensing

To answer many of these questions, we can look at the ways that data creators use licenses when they release their data. The following image summarizes several licenses and the rights associated with them.

There are many different types of licenses, and they can be customized to better support the data management problems that your situation has.

#### Data Citations

It's important to cite the data that you use in your research.

##### Why cite data?

- Facilitates data discovery & gives researcher credit
- Recognizes data as substantial output of the research process
- Allows for citation/impact analysis, as with article publications

##### How to cite data?

When citing data, include:

- Creator/author e.g. an ORCID ID
- Title
- Publisher
- Publication date
- Version
- Persistent identifier, e.g. a DOI
