### Why should we use metadata?

Metadata is very important and should be used for many reasons. 

#### Metadata Fills the Gaps in Data
<br/>
<br/>

Metadata helps us answer questions we may have about data:

- Who createed this data?
- What is the content of the data?
- When and where were the data created?
- Where is it located?
- How were the data developed?
- Why was the data developed?

#### Metadata Exsists in Many Places
<br/>
<br/>

All of the following are places metadata could exist:

- Lab documentation
- Raw data files from instruments
- Processed data files
- Field notes
- Spreadsheets
- Lab notebooks
- ReadMe files
- In your brain or your colleagues' brains


#### Why is Metadata Important?

##### It Provides Context for Data Users

- When *providing* data, think about what details should be included
- When *recieving* data, think about what details you would like to know

##### It Limits Information Entropy

Metadata helps keep data useful as time goes on.
